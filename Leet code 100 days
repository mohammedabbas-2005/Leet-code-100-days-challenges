DAY 1 C++
You are given a positive number n.

Return the smallest number x greater than or equal to n, such that the binary representation of x contains only set bits 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5

Output: 7

Explanation:

The binary representation of 7 is "111".

Example 2:

Input: n = 10

Output: 15

Explanation:

The binary representation of 15 is "1111".

Example 3:

Input: n = 3

Output: 3

Explanation:

The binary representation of 3 is "11".

 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000

solutions:
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestNumber(int n) {
        int x = n;
        while ((x & (x + 1)) != 0) {
            x++;
        }
        return x;
    }
};

DAY2:
Minimum number of increment on subarray to form a target array
solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int minNumberOperations(vector<int>& target) {
        int count = target[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < target.size(); i++)
            count += max(target[i] - target[i - 1], 0);
        return count;
    }
};
